                                        <p>Unfortunately, we do not currently offer a version of our software specifically designed for the MAC. Many of our users, however, have successfully employed a PC emulator to enjoy our games. Please visit our Download Page for full details.</p>
                                        <h6>Why is my game so slow?</h6>
                                        <p>The communication between your PC and our servers has been optimized for the fastest response. If you notice that your game goes slowly, there are two likely explanations: 1. The players on the table are taking a long time to act when it is their turn. 2. You may not have a good connection to the Internet.</p>
